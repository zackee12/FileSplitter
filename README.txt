FileSplitter

- Allows the user to specify a maximum file size and creates sub-files

- An exe rebuilds the files automatically as long as they are in the same directory.
The filename or extension also must not change.

- Two separate VS2012 projects are attached.  The FileJoiner exe is embedded in the FileSplitter
